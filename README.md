## Steps for Project

-----------------------

1) Study how to convert audio to frequency waves (graph)
    - Fourier Transform
 --> Decomposes a function into its constituent frequencies.
2) Apply new learned material into JS (using AudioNode) and transform it into code
    - Interface for representing an audio processing module

3) Using Glitch.com (Assets)
    - Upload mp3 files so that I can access them through VSCode
    - this website is going to have all my music files and don't need to include in project file
    since it accesses the files through a web URL
4) Using HTML and CSS to make the website user friendly
5) Use Figma.com to draw an outline on how my multiple pages would look like

**MU3100 Final Project General Ideas** 

- Include music from different eras/centuries/decades
- Have an option to decide what     ''          ''
- Home page decide what era to choose from

**FRONT PAGE**

- Welcome page
- Multiple buttons(at least 6) representing different eras
- Buttons will take you to a different page according to era
  - Pictures representing that certain era for each button
- Have back button on each page other than welcome page
- Title each html page according to its era
- Possibly record a video showing my website
- Find a way so that there is no canvas on the front page

MULTIPLE PAGES (LED FROM BUTTONS ON FRONT PAGE)

- Goal: Include song name, origin, composer, etc
  - Obviously frequency visualizer
  - probably be at the bottom of the page

## 10/3

- Outline my research paper
    1. Intro/Goal
    2. Process (Sections: Coding & Math)
    3. Connection to Unit Material
    4. Reflection / Analysis
    5. Conclusion

- Learn what the html is doing to see if I can delete anything
  so that my html files are not so repetitive

 Fast Fourier Transform

- Algorithm to convert time domain to a frequency domain
- Javascript already implements the algorithm in its libraries
- Include in research paper how the algorithm can be utilized
      although its not necessary

Music

- Each note has an established frequency
- Frequencies combine, they do not average out when multiple notes are played
- Superposition Principle - The net response caused by two or more stimuli is the sum
      of the responses that would have been caused by each stimulus individually
  - Wave Interference - When two or more waves traverse the same space, the net
    amplitude at each point is the sum of the amplitudes of the individual waves

Song #1: Hurrian Hymn No. 6

- Considered the world's earliest melody
- 1400 BCE
- Cuneiform signs of the ancient Hurrian language written on a clay tablet
- Discovered in the 1950s at Ugarit, Syria

Song #2: Epitaph of Seikilos

- Earliest suriving complete musical composition
- 200 BCE to as late as 100 CE
- Ancient Greek musical notation was found engraved on a tombstone from present-day Aydin Turkey
- Notation with markings above them to indicate syllables and pitch
